  <h1>Design Process</h1>
  <p>Our project began as an idea to make meal planning easier for families with young children. We took this core idea and spent time brainstorming about use cases and tasks, and considered adding a scanner to the system as a simplified interface tool. To test our assumptions about the shopping habits and the tools used by our target audiance we gathered data from participants through observation and questioning while they planned and shopped for their meals, a process called a contextual inquiry. </p>
  
    <p>The feedback we received informed our decisions as we refined our focus and, rapid iterations using paper prototypes led the design to its current state. We followed this up with tests to ensure users could reasonably navigate through the layers of our design and accomplish their goals, a process called usability testing. This process of designing, then testing, then refining, and then further testing has helped us acheive a useful, usable, and desirable end product.</p>
      
  <p>Additional details of this progression can be seen in our testing, analysis, and design documents :</p>
