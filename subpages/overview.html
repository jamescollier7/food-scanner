  <h1>Problem Overview</h1>
  <p>Families experience several difficulties associated with shopping for meals, including staying under budget, finding food that accommodates everyone, accounting for dietary restrictions and food aversions, and planning healthy meals with variety. These challenges are complex for a single person, but tracking the preferences and goals of multiple family members can be a major struggle.
</p>
    <h1>Solution Overview</h1>
  <p>We propse the Food Scanner app as a solution to these problems. Instead of an app that meets the needs of a single individual, we are proposing a family-centric app with multiple facets for tracking food allergies and aversions, setting goals, finding and saving recipes, and tracking food consumption -- each of these with family overviews and specifics for family members, which can all be used to help meal-decision making in the future.  The crux of this app is the scanning capability.  The app will allow users to scan nutrition labels in the store to quickly receive feedback about the food, especially information about allergies, goals, and recipe compatibility.  Scanning the receipt is also an option for less tedious operation, and incorporating budget concerns.
